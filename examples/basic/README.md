redux-auth-wrapper basic example
=================================

This is a basic example that demonstrates wrapping components
with authentication and authorization checks. It shows how to handle
nested checks and demonstrates redirect support.

This example uses React-Router 2.x and Redux-Simple-Router 2.x.

**To run, follow these steps:**

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` in this directory (make sure it creates a local node_modules)
2. By default, it uses the local version from `src` of redux-auth-wrapper, so you need to run `npm install` from there first.
3. Build with `webpack --watch`
4. Open `index.html`
