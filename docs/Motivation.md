An alternative approach is to use [Higher Order Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.ao9jjxx89).

Redux-auth-wrapper provides higher-order components for easy to read and apply authentication and authorization constraints for your components.
